## Preface
The football economy is blooming. Players are bought by European clubs for tens of millions of dollars every year.<br>
Also, in the recent years, football went through a major data revolution. Every little action that a player does is measured and well documented, leading to an efficient tool for analyzing a player's performance.<br>
We chose to use some of this data to try to predict a player's value according to the data collected about him.

<br>
<br>

## Research Question
Our research will focus on predicting a player's value by the data collected on him that season.<br>
The German website [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) is the leading source for evaluating a player's value, we will use their valuations as the target variable to test our predictions.<br>
We will rely on the data gathered by [FBref.com](https://fbref.com/) (Football Reference), the attributes are age, average minutes per game, goals, shots on goal, interceptions, distance covered etc.<br>
Full description on the attributes is added as an appendix.<br>
We assume that the attributes relevant to a player differ by his position, for example the goals scored by the player are not relevant if the player is a goalkeeper, but they sure are meaningful if he is a striker.<br>
Because of that we will build a different prediction model for every position.

## Dataset
### kaggle raw data folder
We use two different datasets, both are from Kaggle.<br>

For the players stats we use a dataset which contains data about players from the top 5 leagues in Europe (England, Spain, France, Italy and Germany).
We have two of those, one for the season 2021/22, and one for 2022/23.
- `2021-2022-football-player-stats.csv` - [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20212022-football-player-stats)
- `2022-2023-football-player-stats.csv` - [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20222023-football-player-stats)

Each of them has more than 2500 rows(players) and between 143-124 columns of attributes specified in the appendix.

For the player's price valuation, we use this dataset:
- `player-scores-prices.csv` - [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores)


It is an updating dataset, we are using two of the CSV's in it.<br>
One has a matching between a player and the player's id and position, the other has market valuations for every player id in different dates.<br>
We combined those datasets to 7 CSV's, each for every player position.
In every table, each row represents a player in one of the seasons, and has as columns all of the numerical attributes (115) and the market value that season which is the target column.<br>
The positions chosen are: Goalkeeper, Left/Right back, Center back, Defensive midfielder, Attacking midfielder, Left/Right wing and Center forward. 

- `players.csv` - [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores?select=players.csv) (this file is just for indexing players names to their id)


### processed data folder
In this folder there is a file for each position with 115 columns ready for cleaning and begining the project.
- `combined.csv` - 3787 (all positions) 
- `Back_players.csv` - 611 rows
- `Centre-Back_players.csv` - 666 rows
- `Defensive Midfield_players.csv` - 832 rows
- `Centre-Forward_players.csv` - 574 rows
- `Winger_players.csv` - 536 rows
- `Goalkeeper_players.csv` - 253 rows
- `Attacking Midfield_players.csv` - 314 rows

## Methods:
We will start with exploratory data analysis, in which we will look for missing values and columns that do not look right by plotting the data and comparing the min/max values to the mean and standard deviation, while saving 20% of the data for testing.<br>
Then we will perform PCA to reduce dimensions by looking for correlating variables and observing at the variables factor map.<br>
We will fit a regression model for every position to predict the market value of the player that season using cross-validation.<br>
To make sure our prediction is good enough, we will consider the R2, and compare our predictions on the test cases with the actual market value and look at the error.<br>
Finally, we will look for the most contributing variables to predict the market value, by looking at the p-values.
